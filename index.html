            <h2>My Love,</h2>
            <p>
                Even though I'm miles away, I hope you know I'm always here for you. I know you’ve been a little stressed lately, so I’m sending you this letter to remind you how much I’m proud of you, my pretty girl.
            </p>
            <p>
                The way you keep trying everyday, even when you’re tired, frustrated and overwhelmed by f****** nursing school bro. That hard work and determination is why i admire you so much, Love.
            </p>
            <p>
                You mean so much to me. You make me want to be a better version of myself everyday and I’m so very grateful for your love and patience with me. I’m still learning how to love you right and sometimes i get it wrong but i’ll keep trying, because you are the one i want to be better for.
            </p> 
             <p>
                 So no matter how hard things get, I’m always here for you, supporting you, rooting for you, and loving you. Please don’t ever think that you are a burden to me okay? I want you to tell me how things are going and what you feel. I’m always here to listen, langga.
             </p>  
            <p>
                I’m proud of you always. I hope you know how much i burn for you. And I love you more than you’ll ever know. Let's be weirdos together foreva.
            </p>
